'''
Make sure to not call your application flask.py because this would conflict with Flask itself.
'''

from flask import Flask, render_template
#from wtf.app import app

#First we imported the Flask class. An instance of this class will be our WSGI application.

# referencing this file
app = Flask(__name__)
'''
If you are using a single module (as in this example), you should use __name__ because depending on if itâ€™s started as
application or imported as module the name will be different ('__main__' versus the actual import name). This is needed
so that Flask knows where to look for templates, static files, and so on.
